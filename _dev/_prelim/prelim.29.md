### News / Etc.

* Sorry about the temrporarily broken Web site.  The Bootstrap style I used
  changed unexpectedly.  (I hear it broke many of the Course webs in the
  department.)
* Sorry that I could not be in class on Friday.
* I expect that most upper-level CS classes will fill this semester.
  You help the department better consider stress points and how to address
  them if you register earlier, rather than later.
* No, grading is not done.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and half of
  Sunday were booked.  I spent six hours grading, but that's not enough.
    * Weekdays are booked 8:30-5:00 (and it's preregistration)
    * Tonight: Write draft of your exam.  Write 151 project description.
      (Skip concert.)
    * Tuesday: CSC 151 exam grading.
    * Wednesday: CSC 151 exam grading.
    * Thursday: (Maybe) CSC 301 exam grading.
