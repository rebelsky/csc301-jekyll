    > Bots are small automated programs that index websites, edit Wikipedia entries, spam users, scrape data from pages, launch denial of service attacks, and other assorted activities, both mundane and nefarious. On Twitter bots are mostly spam, but occasionally, theyâ€™re creative endeavors.  Mark Sample will lead participants in the creation of bots that can "reveal the injustice and inequality of the world and imagine alternatives. ... that question how, when, who and why."
