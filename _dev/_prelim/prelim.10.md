### News / Etc.

* Note: I expect that you follow GNU style guidelines when you submit
  C code to me.  If you don't know those guidelines, you can find them 
  on the Interweb.
* Note: You should be using gdb or lldb.  I do not want to see code with
  lots of `printf`s.  
    * Actually, I expect that you would *ever* use `printf` for 
      tracing output.  Use `fprintf (stderr, ...)`

### Upcoming work

* [Assignment 4](../assignments/assignment04), due 10:30 p.m. Next Wednesday
