### News / Etc.

* I've done the first read through of Monday's surveys.  There is not
  clear consensus.  Many people like the chance to think through problems.
  Many would like me to lecture more on the more difficult concepts.
  A few would like to code more in class.
* I was disappointed that none of you attended the CS Extra on Careers
  in Computing.  (Yes, I realize that it's a busy time.)
* I have not yet met with all the people involved in the issue we discussed
  on Monday.  When I've done so, I'll do my best to get exams back to you
  promptly.  (Note that I have not yet paired exams with people.)

### Upcoming work

* [Assignment 6](../assignments/assignment06) due Wednesday after
  break at 10:30 p.m.
* Read Skiena 3.9 (War Story: String 'em up)

### Extra credit (Academic)
