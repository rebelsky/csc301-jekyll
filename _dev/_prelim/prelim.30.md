### News / Etc.

* I expect that most upper-level CS classes will fill this semester.
  You help the department better consider stress points and how to address
  them if you register earlier, rather than later.
* Some interesting courses to consider
    * CSC 161 is an awesome course.  I'm told it's very different than
      151.  (For some, that's a positive.  For others, that's a negative.)
    * Wilson short course: Human Centered Design for Global Social 
      Transformation
    * Wilson short course: Leadership in a Future of Automation and Income
      Inequality.
    * ENG 295-01. Lighting the Page: Digital Methods in Literary Studies.
