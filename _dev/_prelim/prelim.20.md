### News / Etc.

* Quick mid-semester survey.
    * I focus on "talk about a problem in small groups, then as a large group", but we also have other possible approaches, some of which we've used.
        * [1] The current approach is working well.
        * [2] Sam should talk less; let us present our results.
        * [3] Less small group work, lecture more.
        * [4] Less small group work, lecture more (and use slides).
    * Other than getting grading done, what is something that I can do to improve the class?
