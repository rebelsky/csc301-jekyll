The Problem from HackerRank
---------------------------

Work on it.

Debrief
-------

Why are we doing a HackerRank problem in class?

* Being able to implement stuff is good.
* HackerRank problems (or at least this one) ask you to look at common
  data structures in a somewhat different perspective.
* For better or for worse, some job interview will require HackerRank or
  the equivalent.  Practice is good.
* Some of you need support in writing C.  `int *counterp = 0`.

What did you learn trying to implement this?

* Having PMG in your group is a good idea.
* It's hard to implement a data structure you don't completely understand.
* Recursion is your friend.
* Dealing with the null nodes requires extra thought.
* Bad design choices can ripple.
* Working in a group is great because different people have different
  ideas.
* Pictures are helpful.
* Sanity checks are good, but may interfere
