*Summary*:

*Purpose*:

*Collaboration* (written): You may discuss this assignment with anyone you
like, provided you credit such discussion when you submit the assignment.
You will find that you learn the material better more if you follow 
initial design discussions in a group with individual writing.  Each 
person should write up his, her, zir, or their own work and submit it
individually.

*Submitting* (written): Turn in your work in the envelope next ot my
office door.  While I would prefer that you use LaTeX, you may certainly
do your work by hand.  Make sure to include your name, course information,
and date at the top of the page.  If you use paper torn from a loose-leaf
notebook, make sure to remove or trim any lose edges.

*Evaluation*: We will primarily evaluate your work on its *correctness*
(e.g., does it compute what it is supposed to; does it meet the
requirements of the assignment); *clarity* (e.g., is it easy to read,
is it well formatted and documented); and *efficiency* (e.g., does it
achieve its goal quickly and with limited resources).  These criteria
will be modified, as appropriate, for written and coding assignments.

*Warning*: So that this assignment is a learning experience for everyone,
we may spend class time publicly critiquing your work.
