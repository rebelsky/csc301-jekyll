Traversal Algorithms
--------------------

* Summarize the two traversal algorithms

Marking Vertices and Edges
--------------------------

* Many graph algorithms require you to "mark" vertices or edges.
* For example, the traversal algorithms ask us to mark vertices as
  "visited" and "processed"
* Sometimes we have a goal of finding a element with a partiuclar mark.
* How would you implement marking?

Implementing Graphs
-------------------

* Three main approaches
    * Edge lists (+ vertex lists)
    * Adjacency lists
    * Adjacency matrix
* What are the costs for the main operations?
* Is it important that you tune your graph implementation to your
  algorithm?  **Absolutely**
