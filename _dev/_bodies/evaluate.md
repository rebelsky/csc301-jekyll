Debrief
-------

* I sincerely apologize for the lack of feedback you received this semester.
    * For whatever reason, it's a trend in our upper-level theory courses.
    * But it's not what you should get.
* How did you feel about the format of the course?
* What did you think about the book?
* What are things that went well?
* What other things should we improve?

Final Comments

* I enjoyed teaching you.
* Take the time to tell other people they are important to you.
* This class was special.
