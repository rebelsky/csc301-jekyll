The Subject Matter of the Course
--------------------------------

Big Picture

* A toolkit for thinking about algorithm design
* An approach to thinking about the algorithms you design
* "The literature" - Important algorithms, ADTs, and data structures.
* Other Things

### An Approach to Thinking About the Algorithms You Design

* Try examples by hand.
* Try to find a counter-example.
* Try again.
* If you can't find a counter-example, try to prove it correct.
* Show it to someon else.
* Compute its asymptotic behavior.

### A Tookit for Thinking About Algorithm Design

* Primary techniques
    * Divide and conquer
    * Dynamic programmming
    * Greed and modifications thereof
    * Draw the right graph and use a graph algorithm
* "The Literature" (see below)
