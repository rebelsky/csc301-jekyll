Lower Bounds, Revisited
-----------------------

* I was reminded that the better way to do the analysis of O(n!) is to
  think about the value of log(n!).
* log(n!) = log(n) + log(n-1) + log(n-2) + ... + log(2) + log(1)
* Can you use that to determine an upper bounds using O(...) and a
  lower bound using Omega(...)?
