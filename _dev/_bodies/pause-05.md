Big Picture
-----------

Observations:

* Get something working quickly.
* m = n^2 for this graph.

Conclusions:

* Write specific code, not general code.
* As long as our implementation doesn't interfere too much, we can
  probably make this O(n^2).

Types

Vertices/Points

* Vetices are (x,y) positions.  For convenience, we'll want to refer to
  them by number, so we'll put them in a table.
